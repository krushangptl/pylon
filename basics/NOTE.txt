NOTES

Variable 

- In the global scope of variable at some point we done using some variable value and we don't 
need it anymore but as it is global variable it stay in memory utile the program executes.
To save memory we can delete that variable using `del`

`
x = 10

print(x)

del x

`

We can do it in local scope based on condition and situation
